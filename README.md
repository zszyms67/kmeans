# kmeans

A simple function to incorporate a modified k-means clustering which allows each observation a probability distribution of group memberships as defined by the proportions of the reciprocal of the Euclidean distances raised to the power e, where e is any positive real number, from the respective group means. The main objective to optimize is defined as the total weighted sum of squares within clusters. 

This was a university assigment and serves as an educational example for developing simple alogrithms.
